# Contributing to MCreator Fabric Generator

Since we have limited time, we would love to accept pull requests to get things done. We've also put a few ground rules so that pull requests can be maintained easily and follow the same codestyle.

## Contributing Code
* Create a single commit for each feature, rather than making a huge commit for everything
* Keep minor changes like bug fixes and spelling errors a separate commit
* State all your changes
* Do *not* use newline brackets
* Always commit in past tense
* Report to us if an automatic merge can not be performed. If there are conflicts, it is at our discretion to decide.
* Do not send a huge pull request with multiple large and untraceable commits. Instead, create a single pull request for each major change.
* Use descriptive commit messages. A small description of what was done is enough.

## Reporting Issues
* Please describe your issue in detail.
* Provide your mcreator.log file, located in <Userdir>/.mcreator/logs. You might need to enable hidden folders to see this file.
* If your issue is a build error or occurs in-game, please provide the full contents of the "console" tab in MCreator in text format.
* Please share long logs in paste websites like [Github Gists](https://gist.github.com/) or [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/).
* We do not provide support for outdated versions.

You must also follow the [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/ClothCreators/MCreatorFabricGenerator/blob/1.15.2/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
