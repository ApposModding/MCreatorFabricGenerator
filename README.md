## Important Information

- If you have made a workspace with a version older than 0.4.0, you need to create a new one since the workspace format has been changed.

- To use the latest version of the plugin, you need to have the latest version of MCreator, **including snapshots**.

- Always back up your workspace before updating to a newer version of the plugin.

- Mods may also require [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) to function properly, so when you build your mod, make sure you have fabric api.
